Now we are going to use this values to simulate \\(n\\) observations for a continuous distribution and sum them up. This will be our simulated severity loss. Gamma, Log-normal and Weibull.

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2022) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015).
